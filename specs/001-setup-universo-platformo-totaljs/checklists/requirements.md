# Specification Quality Checklist: Initialize Universo Platformo Total.js Project

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-11-15  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - NOTE: For infrastructure setup features, technical requirements ARE the feature deliverables
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs - Developer productivity and proper project foundation
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders - Clear explanation of what will be delivered
- [x] All mandatory sections completed - User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria all present

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain - All requirements are well-defined
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous - Each FR can be verified
- [x] Success criteria are measurable - All SC have clear metrics (time, percentages, counts)
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details) - Refined to focus on outcomes
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined - Each user story has complete acceptance criteria
- [x] Edge cases are identified - 5 edge cases documented
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded - Comprehensive "Out of Scope" section with 10 items
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified - 10 assumptions and dependencies documented

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria - Each FR is verifiable
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows - 5 prioritized user stories covering all aspects
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria - All outcomes align with requirements
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification - Appropriate for infrastructure setup feature

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Date**: 2025-11-15

All checklist items have been validated and passed. The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for the next phase.

**Special Note**: This is an infrastructure/setup feature where technical stack selection is part of the requirement (not implementation detail). The feature deliverable IS the configured technical infrastructure.

## Notes

No issues found. Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
